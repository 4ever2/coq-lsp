# coq-lsp 0.1.2: Message
------------------------

 - Send an error to the client if the client and server versions don't
   match (@ejgallego, #126)
 - Parse options -noinit, -indices-matter, and -impredicative-set from
   `_CoqProject` (@artagnon, @ejgallego, #140, #150)
 - Log file `log-lsp.txt` has been removed in favor of `coq-lsp.trace.server`
   (@artagnon, @ejgallego, #130, #148)
 - Added --bt flag to print a backtrace on error (@Alizter, #147)
 - A detailed view of Coq errors is now displayed in the info panel
   (@ejgallego, #128)
 - Coq "Notice" messages, such as the ones generated by `About` or
   `Search` are not shown anymore as diagnostics. Instead, they will
   be shown on the side panel when clicking on the corresponding
   command. The `show_notices_as_diagnostics` option allows to restore
   old behavior (@ejgallego, #128, fixes #125)
 - Print some more info about Coq workspace configuration (@ejgallego, #151)
 - Admit failed `Qed` by default; allow users to configure it
   (@ejgallego, #118, fixes #90)
