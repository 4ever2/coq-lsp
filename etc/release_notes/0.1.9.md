Dear all,

we are happy to announce the 0.1.9 release of `coq-lsp`.

This release brings many new features and fixes, in particular:

- new on-demand checking mode: `coq-lsp` can now check files on
  demand, either by following the goals requested, or by following the
  current viewport of your editor. Combined with the new keybinding
  `M-n/M-p` for moving between Coq sentences, this provides a mode
  similar to the usual one in Proof General. Additionally, we now show
  real-time server status and checking information in the VSCode
  language status area.

- new interruption support using `memprofs-limits` (only in OCaml
  4). This solves all known cases of the server hanging.
  (By E. J. Gallego Arias, thanks to Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni and
  Alex Sanchez-Stern).

- `petanque`: a new server built on top of Fl√®che specifically
  targeted at high-throughput low-latency reinforcement learning
  applications. A subset of `petanque` has been experimentally
  embedded into LSP for profit of extensions. (By E. J. Gallego
  Arias, Guillaume Baudart, and Laetitia Teodorescu; thanks to Alex
  Sanchez-Stern).

- Coq meta commands `Reset` / `Reset Inital` and `Back` are supported,
  together with the incremental checking engine they do provide some
  interesting document splitting and isolation features.

- New user manual with some information on how to start with `coq-lsp`

- improved support for VSCode Live Share; full support requires
  approval from Microsoft, please see below if you are interested in
  helping with this.

- new `Free Memory` server command.

- server settings are now updated on the fly when edited in VSCode.

- new heatmap feature to detect execution time hotspots in your Coq
  documents, by Ali Caglayan; plus many more improvements and fixes
  w.r.t. performance monitoring.

- locations are now stored in the server in protocol format, this
  should solve some Unicode issues present in previous versions
  (by E. J. Gallego Arias and Leo Stefanesco).

- many improvements to both client and server plugin API

This version should be much more usable for a large majority of users,
we encourage you to test it!

Please see the detailed Changelog below.

We'd like to thank to all the contributors and bug reporters for their
work; contributions, bug reports, and feedback over `coq-lsp` are much
welcome, get in touch with us at GitHub or Zulip if you have
questions or comments.

`coq-lsp` is compatible with Coq 8.17-8.19 and master. The `fcc`
compiler has been ported back to 8.11, for the benefit of some SerAPI
users.
