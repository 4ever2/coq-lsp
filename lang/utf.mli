(** This module provides facilities for translating language-based locations to
    protocol-based locations.

    After a long discussion (thanks LÃ©o !), we have decided that the best is to
    have `Lang.Point` to store columns offset in the values that are native to
    the protocol under consideration, set by the upper layers.

    This scheme kind of follows what we have done since the start with coq-lsp. *)

module Encoding : sig
  (* Used for char offsets *)
  type t =
    | Utf8
    | Utf16
    | Utf32
end

(* Future work: support multiple encondings *)
(* val set_protocol_encoding : *)

(* utf8 utils, both Coq and Camomile have similar implementations, at some point
   we should remove this but for now we keep it internal. For now we use the
   Camomille functions *)

    - character, code point: The real unicode character
    - byte or 16bit offset / code unit: The encoded version *)
