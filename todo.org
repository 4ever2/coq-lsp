* Minor bits

- remove Coq-specific bits from lsp_* [maybe make the modules a functor]
- better handling of protocol IO / different kind of requests

* Document-related

- Prefix-based incremental checking
- Lazy checking? What can we use for the UI?
- Classification is a pain and fragile, what should the replacement be?

* Control thread:

- before master sends a task, it should check if the previous one was
  cancelled, otherwise it should signal then send a new task.

  No point on sending a task if the worker is not ready.

- master / worker

- define protocol as DSL, serialize with ppx

- use Jane Street Async stuff to interact with processes? Does it work
  on Win?

- what about Lwt? Does it work on Win?
